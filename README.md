# Developing a Node.js app with Cassandra API using Azure Cosmos DB
Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed multi-model database. One of the supported APIs is the Cassandra API. This sample walks you through creation of keyspace, table, inserting and querying the data.


## Running this sample
* Before you can run this sample, you must have the following perquisites:
	* An active Azure Cassandra API account - If you don't have an account, refer to the [Create a Cassandra API account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/documentdb-create-account/) article.
	* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version v0.10.29 or higher.
	* [Git](http://git-scm.com/).
  * [Node.js driver for apache cassandra](https://github.com/datastax/nodejs-driver) // to install the driver - run npm install cassandra-driver 


1. Clone this repository using `git clone git@github.com:Azure-Samples/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-cassandra-node-getting-started.git cosmosdb`.

2. Change directories to the repo using `cd cosmosdb`

3. Next, substitute the contactPoint, username, password  `config.js` with your Cosmos DB account's values from connectionstring panel of the portal.

	```
	config.username = '<fillmein>';
	config.password = '<fillmein>';
	config.contactPoint = '<fillmein>:10350';
	
	```

5. Run `npm install` in a terminal to install required npm modules
 
6. Run `node uprofile.js` in a terminal to start your start your node application.

## About the code
The code included in this sample is intended to get you quickly started with a Node.js console application that connects to Azure Cosmos DB with the Cassandra API.
